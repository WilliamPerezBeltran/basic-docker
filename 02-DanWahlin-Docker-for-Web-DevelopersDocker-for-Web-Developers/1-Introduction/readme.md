# Welcome to the Docker for Web Developers Course!

**NOTE**: This repository provides code for the 2023 version of the Docker for Web Developers course. If you're looking for the older [2020 version of the course](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/docker-web-development), switch to the `2020-course` branch.

This course provides a practical hands-on introduction to Docker from a web development standpoint. It is designed to get you up and running with Docker in your day-to-day web development as quickly as possible.

Locate the commands and demos run in the different course modules in the associated folders in this repository.

I hope you enjoy the course!
